# ConvexHull
Repository for ConvexHull project for CS375


Our project this week was to examine the problem of the convex hull identification and how parallelizable it is. The convex hull of a set S of points is the collection of the smallest convex set containg S. A set is said to be convex if for any two points in the set, the line between them is also in that set. The convex hull problems is well known as an interesting computational geometry problem, a trait that is mostly due to its vast number of applications. 

There are a variety of known algorithms to solve the convex hull problem, at a variety of different space and time efficiencies. 

To start, we worked on a sequential method and made sure that our code could handle a variety of inputs.
